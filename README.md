The model is a convolutional neural network with 4 convolution layers and one dense layer trained on 100 epochs.  For now, This is all i have done but i am working on improving the accuracy

The data consists of 3873 images labeled for each gesture such as rock, paper and scissor. All the data was generated by me

# Installation

First of all make sure you have python installed. In this project I used python 3.8 but most versions will work. However **Python 3.9** will not work yet as tensorflow does not have support for it yet.

You can download the project directly from here or download it from the command line using git
```
>git clone https://github.com/fwizz/rock-paper-scissors
```

Once you have downloaded the project you will need to install the requirements
```
>cd rock-paper-scissors

>pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running

To run the rock paper scissors game all you will have to do is
```
>python main.py
```
If you want to test out the algorithm only, You will have to do this instead
```
>cd misc

>python test_video.py
```
